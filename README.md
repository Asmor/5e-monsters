# Adding your own custom content to Kobold Fight Club

Links:
* Master sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ngAA7d1eYKiBtKTsg8Qcsq_zhDSBzEMxXS45eCdd7I/
* Template: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_cFPf4OGh9QC0WN-cvEWGBNYzCTw--GnPQLzpibkOwk/
* Sheet checker: http://kobold.club/5e-monsters/sheet-check.html

1. Make a copy of the template
	1. Go to the template
	2. Make sure you're logged into a Google account
	3. Click File -> Make a copy
2. There are two sheets in the template. You'll need to fill out both sheets.
	* See the master sheet for examples of how to fill out the sheets
	* Specific notes for **Monsters** sheet
		* **fid** must be unique for each monster, and should be derived from the monster's (exact!) name. The format of fid is "source.name", where source is a short code for the source the monster comes from and name is its name, with all special characters removed and dashes seperating words. For example, consider these two monsters:
			* Aerisi Kalinoth
				* fid: `apoc.aerisi-kalinoth`
			* Aerisi Kalinoth (in lair)
				* fid: `apoc.aerisi-kalinoth-in-lair`
			* These are actually the same monster, except one is the monster in its lair and one is not. Since the monster has a higher CR in its lair, it gets a separate entry.
			* This monster is in the Princes of the Apocalypse supplement. All monsters from this supplement use the `apoc` code, which I chose arbitrarily. The important thing when choosing this code is that it is unique (no two sources should have the same code).
			* If a monster is in multiple sources, choose the "most important" one and use the code from that. For example, all the monsters in the basic rules are also in the Monster Manual, which is the more important source, so they all use the `mm` code.
			* Finally, note how "Aerisi Kalinoth (in lair)" is translatd to `aerisi-kalinoth-in-lair`. All punctuation is removed, hyphens are placed between each word, and it's written entirely lower-case.
		* The **alignment** field is very flexible. Whatever you write will be presented to the user as-is in the alignment field in KFC. However, it will also attempt to parse what you've written to determine what alignments are allowed. You can include multiple alignments by separating them by commas or the word or. You can also use terms like "any good", "non-evil", etc.
		* **environments** is a comma-separated list of environments the monster can be found in. Allowed environments are:
			* aquatic
			* arctic
			* cave
			* coast
			* desert
			* dungeon
			* forest
			* grassland
			* mountain
			* planar
			* ruins
			* swamp
			* underground
			* urban
		* **lair**, **legendary**, and **unique** are all qualities the monster entry might have. If a monster has that quality, you should put that word in that column (e.g. if a monster is unique, write "unique" in that column). Otherwise leave that column blank.
			* **lair** means the monster is being encountered in its lair. Often monsters will have a different CR when in their lair, so you'll have two entries for the monster; one in lair, one not. You should also include (in lair) at the end of the monster's name for the row where it's in its lair.
			* **legendary** means the monster has legendary actions.
			* **unique** means the monster is a unique individual, rather than a type of monster. Unique monsters will never be chosen for a random encounter. Typically these are NPCs in adventures, demon lords, named monsters, etc.
		* **sources** is a comma-separated list of sources where the monster can be found, in the format "Full Source Name: Where". Examples:
			* `Basic Rules v1: 54, HotDQ supplement: 7, Monster Manual: 345`
				* Located in those 3 sources, at each of those pages. Note that the page numbers are not preceeded by "p.". They should just be numbers.
			* `Monster-A-Day: https://www.reddit.com/r/monsteraday/comments/3rdrry/day_79_chronomancers/`
				* In this case the monster comes from a website, and we give a specific URL. KFC will provide a link to the monster.
	* Specific notes for **Sources** sheet
		* **type** is what sort of content this is. In a future update, KFC will sort sources based on their type. Standard types are:
			* Official
				* 5th edition books published by Wizards of the Coast
			* Official Adventure
				* 5th edition adventures published by Wizards of the Coast
			* Official Web Supplement
				* 5th edition supplements published online by Wizards of the Coast
			* Third-Party
				* 5th edition books published by companies other than Wizards of the Coast
			* Community
				* Content created by fans
			* Other
				* You can use any type you want. I recommend "Homebrew" for your own personal content.
		* **name** is the full name of the source, and should exactly match the name of the source as you used it in the monsters sheet. If the names don't match exactly, monsters won't be linked to their sources correctly.
		* **short name** is the short name for the source. This is used on narrow screens such as phones. It should be something easily identifiable and unique. It may be the same as the fid code, but doesn't have to be. Examples:
			* Monster Manual: `MM`
			* Monster-A-Day: `MAD`
			* Curse of Strahd: `Strahd`
			* Fifth Edition Foes: `5eF`
			* Primeval Thule Campaign Setting: `ThuleCS`
		* **link** is a link to the source. This should be a landing page of some sort, not a direct link to a PDF. For example, a blog post, a reddit threat, an online store front.
3. Go to the sheet checker (see links section above). Put the URL for your sheet in the box and click the button. Fix any errors you get and try again.
4. Once you're done, click "Manage Custom Content" in KFC. Put the URL for your sheet in the field that says URL, give it a name, and click add. If you've done everything correctly, your monsters will now be integrated into the list.

# Contributing content to Kobold Fight Club

User-submitted content is no longer accepted directly into KFC. Instead, if you'd like to share, post a link to that content in [This reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asmor/comments/fgcrif/list_of_communityadded_kfc_content_4_thats_100_in/) with a link to the sheet and a description of its contents.

I _may_ end up making a wiki page to organize and curate these links, but I make no promises.

# Why is KFC no longer accepting user-submitted content?

Two reasons, both ultimately my own fault.

1. It was really unsustainable. I haven't run into any issues yet, but eventually there would be so many entries that something would give (browser storage limits, performance, Google Sheets' API, etc). I'm not really doing things in a very efficient way, and it would be a nightmare to put that genie back in the battle if/when that happens, so better to take care of it now.
2. Due to various poor design decisions, it's very difficult and time consuming to add new content to the existing sheets. I've recently started turning down many requests, which understandably upset people.

I've already got a lot of difficulty motivating myself to maintain KFC (even if that maintenance at this point is largely just testing and accepting pull requests from the excellent contributors to this project), and having this cloud of outstanding submissions that I either had to add or turn down was really killing my morale.
